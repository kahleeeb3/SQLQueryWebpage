    <h1>COMP 5120/6120 Database Systems I</h1>
    <h2>Term Project: Populating and Querying Databases with SQL</h2>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
        In this project, you are to create a database for a hypothetical online bookstore system.
        The system maintains information about books, subjects, supplier, and shippers. The
        bookstore acquires the desired books from suppliers (e.g. Amazon.com), and ships the
        books by shippers (e.g. UPS). The system also keeps track of orders, customers, and
        employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your tasks are the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Create and populate the bookstore database with MySQL.</li>
        <li>Create a user interface using PHP and HTML to query and modify the data.</li>
        <li>Write correct SQL statements for the queries given.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Queries Input</h3>
    <div id="query-submit">
        <form action="/src/php/submit_sql.php" method="post">
            <textarea name="sql_statement" rows="5" cols="40"></textarea><br><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            <input type="submit" value="Clear">
